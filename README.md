## Instructions

The project is forked from [this project](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page) which has HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing page.

This project converts the static page to an interactive one by adding following features:
1. Builds the sections from a variable having content instead of hard coding into html
2. Builds the navigation links using same variable
3. Scroll to a section on click of navigation link
4. Update active state of links on scrolling to a section

Code to add this functionality is written in `js/app.js` file.
